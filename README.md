## Bank Marketing Dataset – Decision Tree Classifier

This project builds and evaluates a Decision Tree Classifier using the Bank Marketing dataset.  
The dataset is nested inside zipped folders, so the script automatically extracts both ZIP layers, loads the CSV, preprocesses the data, trains a model, and visualizes results.

---

## What this script does

• Extracts **main zip + nested zip**  
• Loads the bank marketing dataset (semicolon separated)  
• Converts categorical columns using one-hot encoding  
• Trains a Decision Tree model  
• Evaluates accuracy + classification report  
• Displays a simplified decision tree visualization  
• Plots Top 10 feature importances

---

## Requirements

Install dependencies:

bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

---

## Output

Running this project will produce:

• Dataset shape & preview
• Missing value check
• Model accuracy score
• Classification report
• Decision tree visualization
• Feature importance bar plot
